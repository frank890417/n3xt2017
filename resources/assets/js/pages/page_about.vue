          h2 What is n3xt con?
          hr
          p n3xt con is a haven for creative and intellectual authenticity. We believe entrepreneurial spirit is an immutable individual trait that cannot be smothered. n3xt con’s mission is to establish an environment in which such spirit not only flourishes but inspires more people to make a long lasting impact in their lives and beyond.<br> <br>As globalization becomes the foundation to our future, it is important for tomorrow’s thought leaders to establish an apolitical vision today. n3xt con sees the future through an entrepreneurial lens. For us, a “startup” merely means a new way of doing things so there is no start-up that is too small or insignificant. On the one hand, we promote scalability while innovating on a global scale, but on the other hand, we want to emphasize the unlimited potential for any innovative problem-solving ideas in daily life.<br><br>Our team consists of individuals from creative, business, technology, and science backgrounds, and it is our dream to expand our community with such diversity across the world.
